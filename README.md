# Pong-in-x86-real-mode
broken Bootsector Pong game ,made in x86 real mode emulated with qemu 

the game has no scoring , all you do is randomly playing with a bot that follows the directions of the ball 


Recently after leanrning how to code in assembly , I'm making a few projects in real mode, 
so I can get comfortable with low level coding , and start learning OSDEV
